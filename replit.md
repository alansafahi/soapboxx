**Latest Enhancement**: Enhanced Bible Translation system with LSB (Legacy Standard Bible) support. System now supports 13 active translations including the newly added Legacy Standard Bible by Grace Community Church and existing NASB support. Fixed dynamic Bible Translation system with complete SBX-STD-004 compliance. System properly handles user's Bible translation preference as a dynamic value that can change at any moment. Fixed auto-save functionality in Profile Editor (corrected database field mapping). All Scripture lookups use current user preference dynamically. Centralized configuration system supports comprehensive API fallback hierarchy. SOAP Entry Form and all components respect real-time changes to user's Bible translation selection.

**Latest Enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive Growth-Focused Strategy with updated reward system and pricing optimization. Successfully updated all point values: Discussions (20 points), Prayer Requests (25 points), Events Attended (25 points), S.O.A.P. Entries (15 points), Prayer Responses (5 points), and Referral Rewards (500 points for both referrer and referee). Added AI feature tracking with 10-point first-time bonus for AI-assisted S.O.A.P. features including suggestions, enhancement, questions, and AI-assist. Implemented processReferralReward function with updated 500-point referral system and bronze/silver/gold/platinum tier structure. Enhanced all AI endpoints (/api/soap/ai/suggestions, /api/soap/ai/enhance, /api/soap/ai/questions, /api/soap/ai-assist) with first-time usage tracking. **Spiritual Plan Names**: Transformed all pricing with biblical inspiration - Individual Plans: Disciple Plan (Free, "Walk with Christ each day"), Servant Plan ($5/mo, "Serve faithfully and grow deeply"), Torchbearer Plan ($10/mo, "Shine your light further"). Church Plans: Shepherd Plan ($50/mo, "Guide your flock with love and order"), Beacon Plan ($100/mo, "Shine brighter, reach farther"), Kingdom Plan ($250/mo, "Lead with vision, empower the body"). Enhanced three-tier church structure with spiritual iconography (üêëüïØÔ∏èüëë) and progressive features for small churches to mega ministries. Each plan includes detailed spiritual features matching comprehensive specifications from user requirements. Implemented enhanced Credit Boost Pack pricing: Small ($25, 2,500 credits), Medium ($50, 6,000 credits), Large ($100, 12,500 credits) - significantly increased credit amounts while maintaining same prices to improve value proposition and encourage higher-tier purchases. **Enhanced Church Loyalty Rewards**: Updated Pastor Essential plan to include 2,500 loyalty credits every 6 months (increased from 1,000) and Shepherd Advanced to include 5,000 loyalty credits every 6 months (increased from 2,000), providing significantly better value for church subscribers. **Grace-Driven Messaging**: Transformed pricing language to spiritual-focused messaging with biblical taglines, button text changed to aspirational calls like "Begin Your Journey", "Step Deeper", "Strengthen Your Ministry", "Expand Your Reach", and "Transform Your Calling". **Enhanced Gamification**: Added comprehensive gamification database schema with missions, enhanced badges, and streak tracking systems to complement existing reward infrastructure. Created AchievementCelebration UI component with grace-driven messaging for milestone celebrations. Updated all pricing information across simple-landing.tsx, FAQ, comprehensive-knowledge.ts, ChatWidget, and routes.ts for consistency. System now fully aligned with competitive growth strategy, spiritual messaging, and improved user engagement incentives.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Focus on functionality over technical implementation details.
Language support priority: Farsi and Armenian above Arabic, Korean above Japanese, Hindi at end.
Visual enhancements: Flag icons for language selection.
Future consideration: Implement same language list on main website (soapboxsuperapp.com).
Code quality emphasis: No hardcoded values in production - all user preferences, settings, and configurations must be dynamically loaded from database/user profiles. Bible translation preferences are completely dynamic (user can change at any moment) - system must always use current user selection, never assume specific translations. Centralized configuration systems for all lookup lists (Bible translations, languages, etc.) maintained in `/shared/` directory.
