**SOAP Cache Keys:**
- `['/api/soap']` → `['/api/soap-entries']`
- `['/api/soap/public']` → `['/api/soap-entries/public']`
- `['/api/soap/all']` → `['/api/soap-entries/all']`
- `['/api/soap/{id}/comments']` → `['/api/soap-entries/{id}/comments']`

**User Profile Cache Keys:**
- `['/api/user/saved-soap']` → `['/api/user-profiles/saved-soap-entries']`
- `['/api/user/church-affiliation']` → `['/api/user-profiles/church-affiliation']`

**Sermon Studio Cache Keys:**
- `['/api/sermon/drafts']` → `['/api/sermon-studio/drafts']`
- `['/api/sermon/completed']` → `['/api/sermon-studio/completed']`

**Admin Portal Cache Keys:**
- `['/api/admin/*']` → `['/api/admin-portal/*']`
