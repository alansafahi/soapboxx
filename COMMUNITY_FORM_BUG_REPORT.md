# Community Creation Form Bug Report

## Issue Summary
**Bug ID**: SOAPBOX-001  
**Date Reported**: July 31, 2025  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Active Investigation  

## Problem Description
Users report that the "Create A Community" form appears non-responsive and they cannot enter data in any fields, despite the form being visible and properly positioned.

## Technical Evidence
### Console Logs Show Form IS Functional
- Input events ARE being captured: `Name input changed: d`, `df`, `f`
- Dropdown selections ARE working: `Community Type selected: group`, `church`
- Event handlers ARE firing correctly

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is **visual feedback**, not functional failure:
1. Form fields appear unresponsive due to styling/visual state issues
2. Users cannot see their input being reflected in the UI
3. Form validation or state updates may not be visually updating

## User Experience Impact
- Users perceive form as completely broken
- Cannot complete community creation workflow
- Affects core application functionality
- Reduces user confidence in platform

## Technical Details
### Components Involved
- `client/src/components/CommunityForm.tsx` - Main form component
- `client/src/components/MyCommunities.tsx` - Modal container
- `client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Dialog/modal system

### Recent Changes
- Converted Radix UI components to native HTML elements for modal compatibility
- Fixed z-index layering issues with dropdowns
- Added debug logging to track input events
- Modal positioning adjustments

### Browser Environment
- Chrome browser on macOS
- Replit development environment
- React with TypeScript, Vite build system

## Investigation Steps Taken
1. âœ… Verified form inputs are receiving events (console logs confirm)
2. âœ… Confirmed dropdown selections work properly
3. âœ… Fixed z-index issues with modal layering
4. âœ… Converted problematic Radix UI components to native HTML
5. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Fix visual state updates and form field rendering

## Immediate Action Plan
1. **Fix Visual State**: Ensure form field values are visually reflected
2. **Form Validation**: Check if validation errors are blocking updates
3. **State Management**: Verify React state updates are rendering properly
4. **User Testing**: Confirm form completion workflow end-to-end

## Workaround
Currently no workaround available - form appears functional but users cannot complete community creation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can type in Community Name field and see text appear
- [ ] All dropdown selections visually reflect chosen values
- [ ] Form submission completes successfully
- [ ] Modal closes after successful submission
- [ ] New community appears in user's community list

## Notes
This is a critical path issue affecting core user workflow. Form functionality exists but visual feedback is broken, creating poor user experience.
