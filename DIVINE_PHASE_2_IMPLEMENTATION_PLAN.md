## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Enhancements
```sql
-- Campus management tables
campuses: id, name, address, primary_contact, settings
campus_administrators: campus_id, user_id, permissions
volunteer_campus_assignments: volunteer_id, campus_id, primary_campus

-- Background check tables  
background_check_providers: id, name, api_endpoint, credentials
background_check_requests: id, volunteer_id, provider_id, status, results
background_check_requirements: role_id, check_type, renewal_months

-- Analytics and reporting tables
volunteer_metrics: volunteer_id, date, hours_logged, engagement_score
ministry_analytics: ministry_id, period, volunteer_count, impact_metrics
dashboard_configurations: user_id, dashboard_type, layout_settings
```

### API Endpoints Enhancement
```typescript
// Background Check Management
POST /api/background-checks/request
GET /api/background-checks/status/:id
