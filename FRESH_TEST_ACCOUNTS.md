# FRESH TEST ACCOUNTS FOR REGISTRATION TESTING

## Password for ALL accounts: `TestPass123!`

## ðŸ†• COMPLETELY FRESH ACCOUNTS (Never been in system)
These emails have NEVER been registered and are perfect for testing the full onboarding flow:

- `newuser3@testflow.com`
- `completely.fresh@testflow.com`
- `brand.new@testflow.com`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Full Onboarding Test**: Use any of the `@testflow.com` emails to test complete registration
2. **SMS Verification Test**: After registering, login and test the SMS verification system
3. **Error Handling Test**: Try to register the same email twice to test the "account already exists" flow
