        question: "Jesus contrasts earthly treasures that decay with heavenly treasures that last forever. What earthly possessions or achievements are you most tempted to cling to as sources of security or identity? How might viewing your resources as tools for building God's kingdom rather than monuments to your success change your priorities? What would it look like to invest more intentionally in relationships and spiritual growth this week?"
      },
      {
        day: 7,
        question: "Jesus teaches that faithfulness in small matters reveals our readiness for greater responsibilities. In what small areas of stewardship (time management, care for possessions, integrity in details) is God currently testing your faithfulness? How might your handling of everyday resources be preparing you for greater kingdom opportunities? What specific area of 'little things' could you surrender more fully to God's purposes?"
      },
      {
        day: 8,
        question: "Paul instructs the wealthy to be rich in good deeds and generous in sharing, storing up treasure for the coming age. How does your current standard of living reflect your understanding of true wealth? What specific ways could you use your resources to impact eternity rather than just enhance your comfort? Consider someone in your community who needs encouragement or practical help - how might God be calling you to be rich toward them this week?"
      },
      {
        day: 9,
        question: "Jesus' parable reveals that God expects us to multiply what He's entrusted to us according to our abilities. What unique gifts, resources, or opportunities has God placed in your hands that you might be burying out of fear or neglect? How could you take a calculated risk to use your talents more boldly for God's kingdom? What would faithful stewardship look like if you truly believed God would hold you accountable for how you invested His gifts?"
      },
      {
        day: 10,
        question: "Paul quotes Jesus saying it is more blessed to give than receive, revealing God's upside-down kingdom values. Think about recent experiences of both giving and receiving - which brought deeper joy and satisfaction? How might embracing the truth that giving is actually receiving reshape your approach to relationships, work, and community involvement? What act of giving could you pursue this week simply for the joy of blessing someone else?"
      },
      {
        day: 11,
        question: "Jesus warns about the dangers of trusting in wealth rather than God. What areas of your life reveal that you might be placing more confidence in your bank account, possessions, or economic stability than in God's provision? How might the story of the rich young ruler challenge you to examine what you're unwilling to surrender for the sake of following Christ more fully? What would radical trust in God's provision look like in your current financial decisions?"
      },
      {
        day: 12,
        question: "The widow's offering demonstrates that God values the heart behind giving more than the amount given. When you give or serve, are you more concerned with others' recognition or with God's approval? How might comparing your giving to others' contributions rob you of the joy and spiritual growth that comes from sacrificial generosity? What 'widow's mite' offering could you make this week that represents genuine sacrifice and trust in God's provision?"
      },
      {
        day: 13,
        question: "Paul reminds us that doing good and sharing are sacrifices that please God. In what ways do you currently view acts of service and generosity - as burdens to fulfill or as worship offerings to God? How might reframing your giving and serving as spiritual sacrifices transform both your motivation and your joy in these activities? What specific act of service or generosity is God prompting you toward as an offering of worship?"
      },
      {
        day: 14,
        question: "Jesus promises rewards for those who give in secret, revealing God's intimate awareness of our hidden acts of generosity. What motivates your giving - recognition from others or relationship with God? How might choosing to give or serve anonymously actually increase your spiritual growth and satisfaction? What opportunity for secret generosity could you pursue this week simply for the joy of blessing someone without any expectation of credit or thanks?"
      },
      {
        day: 15,
        question: "Zacchaeus' transformation demonstrates how encountering Jesus leads to radical generosity and restitution. What relationships or situations in your life need the healing that comes through generous restitution or sacrificial giving? How has God's grace toward you motivated you to be more gracious and generous toward others? As you complete this study, what specific commitment will you make to live more generously as a response to God's abundant grace in your life?"

Consider how the biblical characters in this passage chose faith over fear - what specific step of faith is God calling you to take? How might their example encourage you to trust God's character even when His ways don't align with your understanding?`,
    
    'trust': `In what areas of your life do you struggle to trust God's timing or methods, and how does ${scripture_reference} speak to those specific concerns? What would it look like to surrender your need for control in these situations and instead rely on God's wisdom and provision? How might trusting God's goodness, even in uncertainty, change your daily decisions and emotional responses?`,
    
    // Prayer and Worship themes
    'prayer': `How has your prayer life been affected by current circumstances, and what does ${scripture_reference} teach about maintaining consistent communication with God? What barriers (busyness, doubt, disappointment) prevent you from experiencing deeper intimacy with God in prayer? How might the prayer principles in this passage transform both your approach to God and your expectations of His response?`,
    
    'worship': `What competes with God for your worship and attention in daily life, and how does ${scripture_reference} call you to reorient your priorities? In what practical ways could you cultivate a lifestyle of worship that goes beyond Sunday services? How might seeing all of life as an opportunity to honor God change your perspective on work, relationships, and challenges?`,
    
    // Love and Relationships themes
    'love': `Which relationships in your life need the kind of love described in ${scripture_reference}, and what specific actions would demonstrate this love practically? What personal barriers (pride, hurt, selfishness) prevent you from loving others as God commands? How might God's love for you motivate and enable you to extend grace and forgiveness to those who have disappointed or hurt you?`,
    
    'forgiveness': `Who in your life needs your forgiveness, and how does ${scripture_reference} challenge your current attitude toward them? What would it cost you to extend forgiveness, and what might you gain in terms of freedom and spiritual growth? How does God's forgiveness of your sins provide both the motivation and the power to forgive others who have wronged you?`,
    
    // Wisdom and Character themes
    'wisdom': `What decisions are you currently facing that require godly wisdom, and how do the principles in ${scripture_reference} apply to these specific situations? Where do you typically turn first for guidance - human advice, past experience, or God's Word? How might developing a more consistent practice of seeking God's wisdom through Scripture and prayer impact your decision-making process?`,
    
    'character': `What character traits does ${scripture_reference} highlight, and which of these qualities most needs development in your life? What circumstances or relationships are currently revealing gaps in your character that God wants to address? How might allowing God to shape these areas of weakness actually become opportunities for His strength to be displayed through you?`,
    
    // Service and Mission themes
    'service': `How is God currently calling you to serve others, and what does ${scripture_reference} teach about the heart attitude behind biblical service? What prevents you from serving more wholeheartedly - time constraints, fear of commitment, or desire for recognition? How might viewing service as worship and partnership with God transform both your motivation and your joy in helping others?`,
    
    'mission': `What opportunities do you have to share God's love with those around you, and how does ${scripture_reference} encourage you to be more intentional about this calling? What fears or insecurities hold you back from being a witness for Christ in your daily interactions? How might focusing on God's heart for the lost motivate you to step outside your comfort zone in relationships and conversations?`
