    return `The New Testament revelation in ${scripture_reference} contributes to the grand narrative of God's redemptive plan fulfilled in Jesus Christ and lived out through His church. This passage demonstrates how the apostolic witness establishes foundational truths about salvation, sanctification, and Christian community that transcend cultural and temporal boundaries. The early church's response to Gospel truth provides timeless principles for how believers should navigate faith, relationships, and mission in every generation. As we survey these New Testament themes, we discover that the challenges faced by first-century Christians often mirror our contemporary spiritual struggles with doubt, persecution, moral compromise, and maintaining unity amid diversity. These scriptural insights invite us to consider how the Gospel should continue to shape our personal discipleship, church life, and witness in today's world with the same transformative power demonstrated throughout the apostolic era.`;
  } else if (planLower.includes('wisdom literature')) {
    return `The wisdom principles revealed in ${scripture_reference} offer divine insight for navigating life's complexities with godly understanding and practical skill that honors God in daily decisions. This passage contrasts human wisdom, which relies on limited perspective and cultural trends, with divine wisdom that flows from reverent relationship with the Creator and results in righteous living. The practical applications of biblical wisdom touch every aspect of human experience - our work, relationships, finances, character development, and response to both success and adversity. Unlike worldly wisdom that changes with circumstances and cultural shifts, God's wisdom provides unchanging principles that lead to flourishing life and peaceful relationships. As we meditate on these wisdom truths, we're challenged to move beyond mere intellectual understanding to embodied wisdom that transforms our heart motivations, decision-making processes, and interactions with others in ways that reflect God's character and purposes.`;
  } else if (planLower.includes('spiritual disciplines')) {
    return `The spiritual discipline highlighted in ${scripture_reference} provides a pathway for deepening our relationship with God through intentional practices that create space for divine transformation and spiritual formation. This passage reveals how consistent spiritual habits - prayer, meditation, Scripture study, fasting, worship, solitude, service - become means of grace that shape our hearts, renew our minds, and align our will with God's purposes. Unlike empty religious ritual or legalistic obligation, authentic spiritual disciplines are expressions of love and hunger for God that position us to receive His grace and respond to His Spirit. The biblical foundation for these practices shows that spiritual growth requires both human effort and divine enablement, creating collaborative opportunities where God works in us and through us. These disciplines challenge contemporary believers to move beyond casual, convenience-based faith toward intentional, costly discipleship that prioritizes spiritual formation over cultural accommodation and creates margin for encountering the living God.`;
  } else if (planLower.includes('servant leadership')) {
    return `The servant leadership principles demonstrated in ${scripture_reference} reveal Christ's revolutionary approach to authority, influence, and power that challenges worldly models of leadership and calls believers to a higher standard. This passage shows how authentic Christian leadership begins with humble service, putting others' needs before personal ambition, and using position to equip and empower rather than control and dominate. The biblical model of servant leadership combines strength with gentleness, authority with accessibility, and vision with compassion in ways that reflect God's character and advance His kingdom purposes. Jesus' example of washing the disciples' feet, sacrificing for others, and investing in their development provides the template for how believers should exercise influence in families, churches, workplaces, and communities. These servant leadership truths challenge us to examine our motivations for seeking leadership, evaluate how we currently use whatever influence we have, and consider how we might better reflect Christ's servant heart in all our relationships and responsibilities.`;
  } else if (planLower.includes('faith under pressure')) {
    return `The faith under pressure demonstrated in ${scripture_reference} reveals how authentic trust in God withstands life's most challenging circumstances and becomes stronger through trials rather than being diminished by them. This passage shows that genuine faith isn't exempt from difficulty but is refined and proven through persecution, loss, disappointment, uncertainty, and opposition from others. When external pressure mounts, our faith either crumbles under the weight or becomes more resilient through dependence on God's unchanging character rather than favorable circumstances. The biblical examples of faith under pressure teach us that maintaining trust during difficulty requires intentional focus on God's promises, community support from other believers, and perspective that sees temporary suffering in light of eternal purposes. This kind of tested faith becomes a powerful witness to watching world and a source of unshakeable hope that enables believers to respond to pressure with grace, endurance, and continued obedience to God's will regardless of external opposition or internal doubt.`;
  } else {
    // Default enhanced devotional for any biblical passage
    return `The biblical truths revealed in ${scripture_reference} illuminate essential aspects of God's character, His relationship with humanity, and practical principles for living according to His design and purposes. This passage invites us beyond surface-level reading into deep contemplation of how these divine principles apply to our contemporary challenges, relationships, and spiritual growth. The timeless wisdom contained in Scripture speaks to universal human experiences while addressing the specific needs of God's people in every generation and culture. These scriptural insights provide both comfort in difficulty and challenge for continued growth, offering hope for the discouraged while calling the complacent to greater commitment. As we allow these biblical truths to penetrate our hearts and minds through meditation, prayer, and practical application, we discover fresh insights into God's unchanging faithfulness and our calling to live as His beloved children who reflect His character in an ever-changing world through authentic discipleship and faithful witness.`;
