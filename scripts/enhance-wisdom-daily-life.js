  1: "James 1:5 reveals God's generous character in providing wisdom to all who ask. This isn't merely intellectual knowledge but practical understanding for navigating life's complexities. The phrase 'without finding fault' shows God doesn't criticize us for needing guidance - He delights in our dependence on His wisdom. This divine wisdom differs from worldly wisdom by beginning with reverence for God and leading to righteous living. When we face decisions, relationships challenges, or uncertain circumstances, we can confidently approach God knowing He eagerly provides the wisdom we need.",

  2: "Proverbs 3:5-6 calls us to trust completely in God's understanding rather than relying solely on our limited perspective. 'Leaning not on your own understanding' doesn't mean abandoning reason but recognizing that human wisdom has boundaries. God sees the complete picture - past, present, and future - while we see only fragments. This trust requires humility to acknowledge our limitations and faith to believe God's ways are higher than ours. When His guidance doesn't align with our expectations, we're called to trust His character and sovereign plan for our lives.",

  3: "The fear of the Lord in Proverbs 9:10 represents reverent awe and recognition of God's holiness, power, and authority. This isn't terror but respectful acknowledgment of who God is and our proper relationship to Him. This fear becomes the foundation for all true wisdom because it establishes the correct starting point - God as Creator and us as His creation. Without this foundation, human wisdom becomes prideful and self-centered. When we begin with proper reverence for God, all other knowledge and understanding finds its proper place and purpose.",

  4: "Proverbs 27:17 uses the metaphor of iron sharpening iron to describe how relationships can refine our character and wisdom. Just as metal becomes sharper through friction with other metal, we grow wiser through meaningful interactions with others. This sharpening process isn't always comfortable - it involves challenge, correction, and growth. The key is choosing relationships with people who share our commitment to godly wisdom and character development. Through honest feedback, accountability, and mutual encouragement, we help each other become more like Christ.",

  5: "James 3:17 describes the characteristics of wisdom that comes from God - pure, peace-loving, considerate, submissive, merciful, fruitful, impartial, and sincere. This heavenly wisdom contrasts sharply with earthly wisdom that breeds envy, selfish ambition, and disorder. God's wisdom produces righteousness and peace in relationships rather than conflict and division. When we operate from divine wisdom, our motivations become pure, our interactions become gracious, and our outcomes reflect God's character. This wisdom is available to all who earnestly seek it through prayer and meditation on God's Word."

// Enhanced reflection questions for practical wisdom application
const wisdomReflections = {
  1: "James 1:5 promises that God gives wisdom generously to all who ask without finding fault. What specific decisions, relationships, or life circumstances are you currently facing that require divine wisdom beyond your own understanding? Consider your typical approach to seeking guidance - do you turn to God first, or do you exhaust human resources before praying? How might developing a habit of asking God for wisdom at the beginning of each day transform your decision-making process and deepen your dependence on His guidance? What would change in your life if you truly believed God delights in providing wisdom to you?",

  2: "Proverbs 3:5-6 calls us to trust in the Lord with all our heart and not lean on our own understanding. In what areas of your life do you find it most challenging to trust God's perspective over your own reasoning or cultural wisdom? Think about recent decisions where God's guidance seemed to conflict with conventional wisdom - how did you respond? What would it look like practically to acknowledge God in all your ways this week, seeking His direction in both major decisions and daily routines? How might surrendering your need to understand everything actually lead to greater peace and better outcomes?",

  3: "Proverbs 9:10 declares that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. How does your reverent awe of God's holiness and authority currently influence your daily choices, priorities, and relationships? Consider areas where you've been making decisions based on personal preference or cultural trends rather than biblical wisdom - what would change if you filtered these through proper reverence for God? How might growing in the fear of the Lord affect your approach to work, money, relationships, and future planning? What specific steps could you take to cultivate deeper reverence for God in your daily life?",

  4: "Proverbs 27:17 teaches that iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens another. Who in your life currently challenges you to grow in wisdom and godly character, and who are you helping to sharpen? Reflect on your closest relationships - are they characterized by mutual encouragement toward spiritual growth, or do they primarily focus on comfort and entertainment? What would it look like to be more intentional about both receiving and providing godly counsel? How might you cultivate relationships that prioritize spiritual growth over mere compatibility or convenience?",

  5: "James 3:17 describes the pure, peaceful, considerate nature of heavenly wisdom. When you examine your recent interactions and decisions, do they reflect the characteristics of godly wisdom - purity of motive, pursuit of peace, consideration for others? Consider specific relationships or situations where you've operated from earthly wisdom (self-interest, pride, manipulation) rather than divine wisdom - what were the results? How might consciously choosing to respond with heavenly wisdom transform your most challenging relationships? What would change in your family, workplace, or community if you consistently demonstrated the wisdom that comes from above?"
