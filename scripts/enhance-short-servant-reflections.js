  // Faith and Trust themes
  generateFaithQuestion: (title, scripture) => 
    `Reflecting on "${title}" and the truths revealed in ${scripture}, what specific circumstances in your life are currently testing your faith in God's goodness and sovereignty? Consider how the biblical characters in this passage chose faith over fear - what practical steps could you take this week to demonstrate similar trust in God's character, even when His ways don't align with your understanding? How might deepening your faith in this area impact your relationships, decisions, and emotional responses to challenges?`,
  
  // Prayer and Worship themes  
  generatePrayerQuestion: (title, scripture) =>
    `The theme of "${title}" in ${scripture} reveals important principles about our relationship with God. How has your prayer life been affected by current circumstances, and what barriers (busyniness, doubt, disappointment, or spiritual dryness) are preventing you from experiencing deeper intimacy with God? What would it look like to implement the prayer patterns or attitudes demonstrated in this passage? How might more consistent and authentic communication with God transform both your perspective on current challenges and your sense of His presence in daily life?`,
  
  // Love and Service themes
  generateLoveQuestion: (title, scripture) =>
    `As you meditate on "${title}" and the love demonstrated in ${scripture}, which relationships in your life need this kind of sacrificial, Christ-centered love expressed more consistently? What personal barriers (pride, hurt feelings, past disappointments, or selfishness) prevent you from loving others as God commands? Consider someone specific who has been difficult to love - how might God's unconditional love for you provide both the motivation and the power to extend grace, forgiveness, and genuine care to them this week?`,
  
  // Wisdom and Character themes
  generateWisdomQuestion: (title, scripture) =>
    `The wisdom principles found in "${title}" from ${scripture} offer divine guidance for navigating life's complexities. What current decisions or relationships require godly wisdom that you've been trying to handle through human reasoning alone? How might the character traits or decision-making processes demonstrated in this passage challenge your typical approaches to problem-solving? What would it look like to seek God's wisdom more consistently through prayer, Scripture meditation, and wise counsel before making important choices this week?`,
  
  // Stewardship and Generosity themes
  generateStewardshipQuestion: (title, scripture) =>
    `"${title}" in ${scripture} reveals God's heart for how we manage the resources, relationships, and opportunities He's entrusted to us. In what areas of your life (time, money, talents, or influence) do you struggle most to remember that you're a steward rather than an owner? How might viewing your current resources as tools for God's kingdom purposes rather than personal security or status change your daily decisions? What specific act of stewardship or generosity is God prompting you toward as a response to His faithfulness in your life?`,
  
  // Spiritual Warfare and Victory themes
  generateWarfareQuestion: (title, scripture) =>
    `The spiritual realities addressed in "${title}" through ${scripture} remind us that our battles often have dimensions beyond what we can see. What recurring struggles, negative thought patterns, or areas of persistent defeat in your life might actually have spiritual warfare components that require God's intervention rather than just human effort? How does understanding your identity and authority in Christ change your strategy for dealing with temptation, fear, or spiritual opposition? What specific truths from God's Word could you use as weapons against the lies or accusations you face most frequently?`,
  
  // Hope and Perseverance themes
  generateHopeQuestion: (title, scripture) =>
    `The hope and encouragement found in "${title}" from ${scripture} speaks directly to seasons of difficulty and waiting. What current circumstances in your life are testing your ability to maintain hope in God's goodness and timing? How might the promises or examples in this passage provide strength for persevering through present challenges with faith rather than despair? What evidence of God's faithfulness in past difficulties can you recall that would encourage you to trust Him with current uncertainties? How could you be a source of hope to someone else who is struggling right now?`
