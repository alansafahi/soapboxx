Scripture: ${scriptureRef}
Title: ${title}
Text: ${scriptureText}

Requirements:
1. SCRIPTURE-SPECIFIC: Must reference specific elements, themes, or characters from this exact passage
2. PERSONALLY APPLICABLE: Connects the ancient text to modern spiritual growth
3. DEEP AND MEANINGFUL: Goes beyond surface-level observations to heart transformation
4. CHALLENGING: Prompts serious self-examination and spiritual reflection

Create ONE powerful reflection question (not multiple questions). Make it profound, specific to this passage, and personally transformative.

Examples of GOOD scripture-specific questions:
- "How does Paul's description of spiritual armor in verses 13-17 reveal specific areas where you might be spiritually vulnerable in your daily battles?"
- "What does David's response to Goliath's taunts teach you about facing the 'giants' that mock your faith today?"

Examples of BAD generic questions to avoid:
- "How can you apply this to your life?"
- "What is God teaching you?"
- "How does this passage speak to you?"

Return only the reflection question, nothing else.`;
