    // Early Life of Christ & Ministry Foundations (Days 1-20)
    (ref) => `The foundational truths revealed in ${ref} establish essential principles for understanding Christ's identity and mission. As you reflect on this passage, what aspects of Jesus' character or ministry challenge your current understanding of what it means to follow Him? Consider how the early church's response to Christ's teachings might inform your own spiritual journey - where do you see similarities between their struggles with faith and your own? How might the Gospel writers' emphasis in this passage speak to specific areas of doubt, fear, or spiritual complacency in your current walk with God? What would authentic discipleship look like if you took this passage's teachings seriously in your daily relationships, work, and personal decisions?`,
    
    // Jesus' Teaching Ministry & Parables (Days 21-40)
    (ref) => `The profound teachings in ${ref} reveal Jesus' revolutionary approach to spiritual truth and kingdom living. What conventional wisdom or cultural assumptions does this passage challenge in your own thinking about faith, relationships, or life priorities? As you examine Jesus' teaching method here, how might He be inviting you to see familiar situations or people from a completely different perspective? Consider the original audience's likely reaction to these words - what comfort or conviction would they have experienced, and how does that mirror your own response? How might applying the principles in this passage transform one specific relationship or situation you're currently navigating? What would change in your community or workplace if you consistently lived out the values Jesus demonstrates here?`,
    
    // Miracles & Signs of Power (Days 41-60)
    (ref) => `The miraculous power displayed in ${ref} demonstrates God's authority over physical, spiritual, and emotional realms. What does this passage reveal about God's heart for human suffering and His willingness to intervene in seemingly impossible situations? As you consider the faith responses of those who witnessed or received these miracles, where do you recognize similar opportunities for trust in your current circumstances? How might Jesus' approach to demonstrating God's power challenge your own methods of representing Christ to others? What barriers - doubt, pride, control, or fear - might be preventing you from experiencing or expecting God's supernatural work in your life? How could this passage reshape your prayers and expectations regarding God's involvement in your daily challenges?`,
    
    // Passion Week & Crucifixion (Days 61-75)
    (ref) => `The redemptive sacrifice revealed in ${ref} represents the climax of God's plan to reconcile humanity to Himself through Christ's willing suffering. As you contemplate the cost of your salvation described in this passage, how does it affect your perspective on current trials, disappointments, or sacrifices in your own life? What does Jesus' response to betrayal, abandonment, and physical agony teach you about handling injustice, rejection, or pain? How might the disciples' various reactions during this period mirror your own responses to crisis or uncertainty? In what ways does understanding the necessity and voluntariness of Christ's sacrifice challenge your approach to forgiveness, service, or personal surrender? How should the reality of what Christ endured for you influence your daily priorities, relationships, and commitment to His mission?`,
    
    // Resurrection & Early Church (Days 76-90)
    (ref) => `The resurrection power and early church dynamics in ${ref} demonstrate Christianity's transformative impact on individual lives and entire communities. What evidence of resurrection life - hope, boldness, love, unity, or supernatural power - do you see (or not see) in your own spiritual experience? As you examine how the early believers handled opposition, internal conflicts, or rapid growth, what insights emerge for navigating challenges in your church, family, or personal ministry? How might the apostolic approach to discipleship, leadership, or evangelism challenge current methods in your spiritual community? What fears, cultural pressures, or comfort zones might be preventing you from experiencing or demonstrating the same kind of transformative faith described in this passage? How could the principles modeled by the early church reshape your understanding of what normal Christian living should actually look like in today's world?`
