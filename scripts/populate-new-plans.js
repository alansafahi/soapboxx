    name: "Thematic Journey: Hope & Healing",
    days: [
      {
        dayNumber: 1,
        title: "God's Promises in Times of Trouble",
        scriptureReference: "Psalm 46:1-3",
        devotional: "In the midst of life's storms, God stands as our refuge and strength. This psalm reminds us that even when the earth gives way and mountains fall into the sea, we need not fear because God is with us. When facing difficulties, we often look for human solutions or temporary fixes, but true healing begins when we recognize God as our ultimate source of strength. His presence doesn't eliminate our troubles, but it transforms how we face them. Take time today to identify one area where you need God's strength and consciously invite His presence into that situation."
      },
      {
        dayNumber: 2,
        title: "Beauty from Ashes",
        scriptureReference: "Isaiah 61:1-3",
        devotional: "God specializes in transformation. What seems broken beyond repair in our lives becomes the very place where His beauty shines brightest. This passage speaks of the Messiah's mission - to heal the brokenhearted and give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes. Often our deepest wounds become the source of our greatest ministry to others. God doesn't waste our pain; He redeems it. Consider how your own experiences of healing might become a source of hope for others facing similar struggles."
      },
      {
        dayNumber: 3,
        title: "The God Who Heals",
        scriptureReference: "Jeremiah 30:17",
        devotional: "God's healing power extends beyond physical ailments to emotional, spiritual, and relational restoration. In this verse, God promises to restore health and heal wounds, even when others have given up on us. His healing often comes gradually, requiring patience and faith. Sometimes healing means complete restoration, other times it means learning to live with grace through ongoing challenges. Trust that God's timeline for your healing is perfect, and His presence sustains you through the process."

    name: "The Armor of God Study",
    days: [
      {
        dayNumber: 1,
        title: "Our Battle is Spiritual",
        scriptureReference: "Ephesians 6:10-12",
        devotional: "Paul reminds us that our struggles are not merely against human opposition, but against spiritual forces of evil. This perspective changes everything about how we approach conflict and challenges. When we recognize the spiritual dimension of our battles, we understand why human strategies often fall short. We need divine armor for divine battles. This week, we'll explore each piece of God's armor and how to put it on daily. Begin by asking God to open your spiritual eyes to see beyond surface-level conflicts to the deeper spiritual realities at work."
      },
      {
        dayNumber: 2,
        title: "The Belt of Truth",
        scriptureReference: "Ephesians 6:14a",
        devotional: "Truth is the foundation of all spiritual armor. Just as a Roman soldier's belt held all other pieces of armor together, truth in our inner parts holds our spiritual defenses together. This isn't just about knowing facts, but about living with integrity and honesty before God and others. Self-deception makes us vulnerable to spiritual attack. Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal any areas where you've been believing lies about yourself, others, or God, and choose to align your thinking with His truth."
