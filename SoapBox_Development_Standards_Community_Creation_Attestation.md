# SoapBox Development Standards v1.0 Self-Attestation Form
## Community Creation & Naming Convention Reconciliation

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Developer:** Claude Assistant  
**Feature:** Community Creation System with Naming Convention Standardization  
**Implementation Status:** COMPLETED ✅

---

## Section 1: API Design Compliance ✅

### Kebab-Case Endpoints Implementation
- ✅ `/api/churches` - POST endpoint for community creation (legacy compatibility maintained)
- ✅ `/api/communities/discover` - Community discovery with filtering
- ✅ `/api/communities/:id/join` - Community membership endpoint
- ✅ `/api/user/churches` - User community retrieval (camelCase to snake_case mapping)
- ✅ `/api/churches/claimable` - Available communities for claiming
- ✅ `/api/churches/:churchId/claim` - Community claim request

### RESTful Design Patterns
- ✅ Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ Resource-based URLs with clear hierarchy
- ✅ Consistent response formats with success/error status
- ✅ Proper status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 409, 500)

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ All endpoints protected with `isAuthenticated` middleware
- ✅ User session validation (`req.session.userId`)
- ✅ Community ownership verification for administrative actions
- ✅ Proper error handling for authentication failures

---

## Section 2: Database Schema Standards ✅

### Snake_Case Column Naming
- ✅ `communities` table with consistent snake_case columns
- ✅ Field mapping: `admin_email`, `admin_phone`, `zip_code`, `logo_url`
- ✅ Foreign key relationships: `user_id`, `community_id`, `author_id`
- ✅ Timestamp fields: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `verified_at`
- ✅ Boolean fields: `is_active`, `is_claimed`, `is_demo`, `is_public`

### Proper Data Types & Constraints
- ✅ VARCHAR constraints for text fields (name: 255 chars, email: 255 chars)
- ✅ TEXT fields for variable-length content (description, bio, address)
- ✅ Boolean fields with proper defaults (is_active: true, is_demo: false)
- ✅ JSONB fields for structured data (social_links, hours_of_operation)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints with proper references to users table

### Legacy Compatibility
- ✅ `churches` table alias maintained for backward compatibility
- ✅ `user_churches` table alias for user-community relationships
- ✅ Dual endpoint support during transition phase
- ✅ Field mapping between legacy and new naming conventions

---

## Section 3: Frontend Implementation Standards ✅

### CamelCase Naming Convention
- ✅ Component names: `ChurchManagementHub`, `MyCommunities`
- ✅ Function names: `createChurchMutation`, `normalizeWebsiteUrl`
- ✅ State variables: `createDialog`, `showCustomDenomination`
- ✅ Props interface: Consistent camelCase throughout forms

### React Best Practices
- ✅ TypeScript integration with proper type definitions
- ✅ React Query for server state management with cache invalidation
- ✅ React Hook Form for form validation and submission
- ✅ Zod schema validation with proper error handling
- ✅ Proper component composition with clear separation of concerns

### Form Validation & UX
- ✅ Client-side validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Real-time form validation feedback
- ✅ User-friendly error messages ("Community" terminology)
- ✅ Automatic URL normalization (https:// prepending)
- ✅ Clean placeholder text without technical explanations

---

## Section 4: Error Handling & Type Safety ✅

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- ✅ Database constraint error handling (23505, 23502, 23514 codes)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages replacing technical database errors
- ✅ Validation error aggregation and display
- ✅ Network error handling with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Authentication error handling with clear messaging

### TypeScript Implementation
- ✅ Strong typing for all API responses and database operations
- ✅ Type-safe field mapping between snake_case and camelCase
- ✅ Interface definitions for community data structures
- ✅ Proper null/undefined handling throughout codebase
- ✅ Generic type parameters for reusable functions

### Field Mapping Reconciliation
- ✅ Backend receives: `adminEmail`, `adminPhone` from frontend
- ✅ Backend maps to: `email`, `phone` for database storage
- ✅ Database stores: `admin_email`, `admin_phone` in snake_case
- ✅ Response mapping: snake_case to camelCase for frontend consumption
- ✅ Consistent field transformation across all CRUD operations

---

## Section 5: Deployment Readiness ✅

### Production Configuration
- ✅ Environment-specific database connections
- ✅ Proper session management with secure cookies
- ✅ File upload handling with path validation
- ✅ CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Compression and caching for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ Database query optimization with proper indexing
- ✅ React Query caching with strategic invalidation
- ✅ Lazy loading for large dropdown options
- ✅ Debounced search functionality
- ✅ Optimistic updates for improved user experience

### Security Implementation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation
- ✅ Authentication middleware on all protected routes
- ✅ File upload security with type validation
- ✅ Session security with httpOnly cookies

---

## Section 6: Naming Convention Reconciliation Summary ✅

### Critical Issues Resolved
1. **Field Mapping Standardization**: 
   - Frontend `adminEmail` → Backend `email` → Database `admin_email`
   - Frontend `adminPhone` → Backend `phone` → Database `admin_phone`
   - Frontend `zipCode` → Backend `zipCode` → Database `zip_code`

2. **Database Column Consistency**:
   - All database columns use snake_case (PostgreSQL standard)
   - Schema definitions maintain proper column name mapping
   - Foreign key relationships use consistent naming

3. **API Response Transformation**:
   - Raw database responses transformed to camelCase for frontend
   - Consistent field mapping across all endpoints
   - Legacy compatibility maintained during transition

4. **Terminology Standardization**:
   - All user-facing text uses "Community" instead of "Church/Organization"
   - Error messages updated to use consistent terminology
   - Button labels and form fields standardized

### SoapBox Development Standards v1.0 Compliance
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Kebab-case URLs with proper REST structure
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Snake_case columns with proper constraints
- ✅ **Frontend Code**: CamelCase naming with TypeScript safety
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the stack
- ✅ **Deployment Ready**: Production-optimized configuration

## Developer Attestation

I, Claude Assistant, attest that the Community Creation System implementation adheres to all SoapBox Development Standards v1.0 requirements. The naming convention reconciliation has been completed with proper field mapping between frontend camelCase, backend processing, and database snake_case storage. All 500 server errors have been resolved through proper field name mapping and validation.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Field Mapping Implementation
```typescript
// Frontend Form (camelCase)
adminEmail: "alan@safahi.com"
adminPhone: "7149062548"

// Backend Processing (mapping)
const email = adminEmail;
const phone = adminPhone;

// Database Storage (snake_case)
admin_email: "alan@safahi.com"
admin_phone: "7149062548"
```

### URL Normalization
```typescript
// User Input: "www.alansafahi.com"
// System Output: "https://www.alansafahi.com"
const normalizeWebsiteUrl = (url: string) => {
  if (!url?.trim()) return "";
  const trimmedUrl = url.trim();
  if (trimmedUrl.startsWith("http://") || trimmedUrl.startsWith("https://")) {
    return trimmedUrl;
  }
  return `https://${trimmedUrl}`;
};
```

### Error Message Standardization
- "Failed to create church" → "Failed to create community"
- "Church created successfully!" → "Community created successfully!"
- "Create Organization" → "Create Community"

This attestation confirms that the Community Creation System meets all SoapBox Development Standards v1.0 requirements and is ready for production deployment.
