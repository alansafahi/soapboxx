✅ UI/UX Enhancements
1. Add a Sticky Contact Widget
Include a floating WhatsApp button or quick contact widget in the lower right corner throughout the site (visible on scroll). Example:
🔵 “Chat with Us” → Opens WhatsApp or Live Chat modal.

2. Icons Consistency
Make icons slightly larger and ensure they're optically balanced (currently the calendar and email icons feel smaller than the message or prayer ones). Use uniform padding inside cards.

3. Section Contrast
Consider subtle divider lines or alternate background shading (e.g., light gray or very soft gradient) between major sections: Contact Options → Form → Social → Prayer → Mission.

4. Optimize the Prayer Wall Callout
It's beautiful — you could add an animation or subtle glow hover effect to make “Visit Prayer Wall” more interactive.

✍️ Copywriting Suggestions
1. Stronger CTA at the Top

🔹 Current: “Contact Us — We’re Here to Support Your Ministry”
🔹 Suggested:
“Let’s Grow Your Ministry — Together”
Subtext: Get answers, request support, or explore how SoapBox can serve your church.

2. Form CTA Button Text

🔹 Current: “Send Message & Stay Blessed”
🔹 Suggested:
“Send My Message” (with optional “🙏 Stay Blessed” subtitle under the button)

3. Add Microcopy Near Form Toggle
For “I am a church leader” — include:
“This helps us tailor our response to your ministry needs.”

🔍 SEO Optimization
1. Add an SEO H1 Tag (and 2–3 relevant H2s)
Make sure <h1> is:
<h1>Contact SoapBox Super App | Faith-Based Church Support & Partnerships</h1>
Use <h2> for:

Support & Technical Help

Schedule a Church Demo

General Inquiries

2. Add Schema Markup for LocalBusiness / Organization
Implement JSON-LD schema to help search engines understand your business. Include:

@type: Organization

address, email, telephone, sameAs (for social links), etc.

3. Add Alt Text to Icons & Logo
Make sure each icon (especially social and support method icons) has descriptive alt text like: "SoapBox email support icon".

4. Add Meta Description for Page
Here’s a sample:

“Contact SoapBox Super App for church tech support, demo requests, prayer help, and ministry partnership opportunities. We’re here to empower your mission with AI-assisted tools for worship, connection, and digital growth.”

🎯 Conversion Strategy Enhancements
1. Add Trust Signals
Below contact methods or form, include logos of churches that use SoapBox (even just 3-4) or a testimonial carousel:

“SoapBox has transformed our church’s ability to connect and grow.” – Pastor Jacob, Grace Chapel

2. Enable Analytics for CTA Tracking
Make sure buttons like “Book a Time”, “Send Message”, and “Visit Prayer Wall” are tracked via Google Analytics or Meta Pixel to monitor conversion.

3. Add FAQ Dropdown Below the Form
Include 3–5 quick questions like:

How quickly do you respond?

Can I use SoapBox if I’m not a church leader?

Do you offer live demos or onboarding help?
