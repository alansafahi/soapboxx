Here’s how I’d map your existing SoapBox Super App reading plans into a tiered, upgrade-enticing structure that encourages users to grow spiritually and move up the subscription ladder.

1. Disciple Plan (Free – Foundational)
Positioning: “Walk daily with Christ — start your journey here.”

Lock advanced study tools (parallel translations, maps, timelines) for higher tiers.

Surface “Next Step” prompts after plan completion that recommend Servant-level plans.

2. Servant Plan (Standard – Enhanced)

Retention Hook:

Release exclusive new Torchbearer plans every quarter so premium users never want to downgrade.

How This Structure Drives Upgrades
Clear Step-Up Value: Each tier adds tools and depth that the previous one can’t match.

Church Integration: Pastors can assign plans across all tiers, but advanced plans only work for members with matching subscriptions.

Gamified Progression: Completing a Disciple plan unlocks badges that hint at Servant/Torchbearer benefits.

Thematic Storytelling: “Disciple → Servant → Torchbearer” feels like a spiritual growth journey, not just a payment plan.
