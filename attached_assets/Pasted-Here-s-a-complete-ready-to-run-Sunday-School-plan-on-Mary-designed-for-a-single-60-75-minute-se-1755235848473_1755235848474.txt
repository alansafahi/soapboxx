Here’s a complete, ready-to-run Sunday School plan on **Mary**—designed for a single 60–75 minute session, with options to scale up or down and adapt for different ages. It focuses on **three Marys** in the Gospels to highlight courage, listening, and witness.

# Lesson Overview

* **Title:** The Marys—Courage, Listening, and Witness
* **Age Range:** adaptable K–5 (with MS/HS notes)
* **Length:** 60–75 minutes
* **Big Idea:** God meets ordinary people and invites extraordinary “yes.”
* **Memory Verse (choose one):**

  * Luke 1:38 (“I am the Lord’s servant… May your word to me be fulfilled.”)
  * or Luke 1:46–47 (“My soul magnifies the Lord…”)
* **Key Scriptures:**

  * **Mary, mother of Jesus:** Luke 1:26–38; 46–55
  * **Mary of Bethany:** Luke 10:38–42; (optional) John 12:1–8
  * **Mary Magdalene:** John 20:11–18

# Learning Outcomes (measurable)

By the end, students can:

1. **Identify** the three Marys and their key moment.
2. **Explain** one way each Mary models discipleship (courage, listening, witness).
3. **Practice** a faith response: a “yes” to God, a listening habit, or sharing good news.
4. **Recite** the chosen memory verse (or paraphrase meaningfully).

# Schedule (sample 70 minutes)

1. **Welcome & Warm-Up (10 min)**

   * Name tags; quick poll: “What’s something hard you said ‘yes’ to this week?”
   * Icebreaker game: **“Secret Messenger”** (telephone-style) to tee up the idea of *good news* and *listening carefully*.

2. **Worship/Prayer (5 min)**

   * Simple chorus or short prayer of thanks for God’s guidance.

3. **Scripture Exploration: 3 Stations (25 min total; \~8 min each)**
   Divide room into **three stations**; rotate small groups counterclockwise. Give each station a simple sign and a take-home card.

   * **Station A — Mary, Mother of Jesus (Courage):**
     *Read:* Luke 1:30–38.
     *Prompt:* “What would make this scary? What helped Mary say ‘yes’?”
     *Activity:* **“Yes Map”** — kids draw a simple path from FEAR → QUESTIONS → TRUST → YES. Older students add one doubt and one promise from the text.
   * **Station B — Mary of Bethany (Listening):**
     *Read:* Luke 10:38–42.
     *Prompt:* “What distracted Martha? What helps you focus on Jesus?”
     *Activity:* **“Stop & Listen Challenge”** — 60 seconds of silent listening while leader reads one verse slowly; students write or draw what stood out.
   * **Station C — Mary Magdalene (Witness):**
     *Read:* John 20:14–18.
     *Prompt:* “What changed Mary’s tears into joy?”
     *Activity:* **“First Witness Relay”** — one student reads a short summary card; they must tell the next student, and so on, ensuring the final version still says: *“Jesus is alive, and He called me by name.”*

4. **Whole-Group Debrief (10 min)**

   * On a board, make three columns: **Courage — Listening — Witness**.
   * Ask for one takeaway per station.
   * Connect to **Memory Verse**; quick call-and-response reading.

5. **Response & Craft (15–20 min)** *(choose by age group)*

   * **K–2 Craft:** **“Fiat Flower”** (Mary’s *fiat* = “let it be”). On a paper flower, each petal says a small “yes” (share, help, pray). Glue/tape to a straw.
   * **3–5 Craft:** **“Magnificat Word Art”** — write/arrange words from Luke 1:46–47 in big letters; decorate with symbols of joy.
   * **MS/HS Activity:** **“My Next Yes” Card** — one concrete step this week (e.g., 5-minute daily quiet, reconcile with someone, share a hope). Encourage pairing with a **“Witness Sentence”**: “I believe Jesus is \_\_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_.”

6. **Memory Verse Game (5 min)**

   * Erase-a-word, hand motions, or speed chain (each student recites the next word).

7. **Closing Prayer & Commission (3–5 min)**

   * Thank God for calling us by name; ask for courage, attention, and boldness to share.

# Materials & Prep

* Bibles or printed passages; station signs/cards; timer.
* Paper (flowers/templates), markers/crayons, glue/tape, scissors, straws.
* Whiteboard/poster board + markers.
* Take-home sheet (family discussion + weekly challenge).
* For MS/HS: index cards for “My Next Yes.”

# Teaching Notes (precision + nuance)

* **Different Marys:** Briefly clarify they’re different people with the same common name.
* **Non-controversial focus:** Keep to what the texts say—Mary’s courage, Mary of Bethany’s attention, Mary Magdalene’s witness—without denominational debates.
* **Application language:** Emphasize God’s initiative; our “yes” is a response to grace.

# Discussion Questions (age-graded)

**K–2**

* What made Mary brave?
* How can we listen to Jesus this week?
* Who can we tell good news to?

**3–5**

* When is it hard to say “yes” to God?
* What distracts you most? How can you make “quiet waters” time?
* If you heard Jesus call your name, what would you do first?

**MS/HS**

* Compare the risks faced by each Mary. Which risk looks most like yours?
* Is busyness ever a way to avoid listening? What practice will you try?
* Craft a 1–2 sentence witness about what you’ve experienced of Jesus.

# Assessment (quick + meaningful)

* **Exit Ticket:** On a sticky note, write one word under Courage/Listening/Witness that you’ll practice this week.
* **Memory Check:** Ask 3–4 volunteers to recite or paraphrase the memory verse.

# Family Take-Home (send home or post in app)

* **Read Together:** Luke 1:46–55 (Magnificat).
* **Talk:** Where can our family say “yes” to God this week?
* **Do:** One “listening minute” before dinner—no devices—each shares one gratitude.

# Adaptations

* **Large Group:** Keep stations but rotate volunteers; project passages on screen.
* **Multi-Age:** Pair older with younger for reading/crafts.
* **Accessibility:** Provide visual timers, printed prompts, quiet corner headphones, and alternatives to public speaking (draw/write).

# Optional Extensions (if you want a 3-week mini-series)

* **Week 1:** Mary, Mother of Jesus — *Courage to say yes* (Luke 1)
* **Week 2:** Mary of Bethany — *Choosing to listen* (Luke 10; John 12)
* **Week 3:** Mary Magdalene — *Witness in the dark turning to dawn* (John 20)

# Quick Safety/Operations (non-obvious essentials)

* Two-adult rule in every room; hallway visibility.
* If sharing “witness sentences,” remind students not to include private addresses/school names.
* Photograph permissions if displaying crafts publicly.
