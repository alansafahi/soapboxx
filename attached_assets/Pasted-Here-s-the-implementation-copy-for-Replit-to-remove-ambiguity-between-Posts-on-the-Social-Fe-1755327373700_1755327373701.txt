Here’s the **implementation copy for Replit** to remove ambiguity between “Posts” on the **Social Feed** and “Posts” inside **Topics**. This update improves UX clarity by separating **broadcast-style** and **discussion-style** content.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Instructions for Replit

---

### 1. **Update Topics Page Labels & Buttons**

**File:** `TopicsPage.tsx` (or wherever Topics tab UI is structured)

#### ✅ Replace:

* `Posts` tab → `Discussions`
* `New Post` button → `Start Discussion`

#### ✅ Update Headline/Subheadline:

**Current:**

```tsx
<h1>Community Discussion Topics</h1>
<p>Connect through posts and topics with your community.</p>
```

**Change to:**

```tsx
<h1>Community Discussion Topics</h1>
<p>Ask questions, start long-form conversations, or share your thoughts for others to respond to.</p>
```

---

### 2. **Ensure Social Feed Uses ‘Post’ Terminology Only**

**File:** `SocialFeedPage.tsx`

#### ✅ Maintain:

* Tab headers: `Latest Posts`, `My Posts`
* Button: `New Post`

#### ✅ Optional (Clarify subtext):

```tsx
<h1>📢 Social Feed</h1>
<p>Share short-form updates, encouragement, photos, or praise reports with everyone in your community.</p>
```

---

### 3. **Prevent Post Creation Inside Topics**

To avoid confusion, **disable or remove** the ability to create “posts” inside the Topics component logic. Only allow new threads via `Start Discussion`.

#### ✅ Topics table should support:

* `title`, `category`, `description`, `comments` (array or subtable)
* Threads = primary objects; replies nested

#### ✅ Posts table (Social Feed) remains independent.

### 4. **Update Routes & Logic (if needed)**

| Component           | Old Route             | New Route                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Posts Tab in Topics | `/topics/posts`       | 🚫 Remove or redirect to `/topics/discussions` |
| Discussions Tab     | `/topics/discussions` | ✅ Keep active                                  |
| Social Feed         | `/home` or `/feed`    | ✅ Show all social posts                        |

---

### 5. **UI Elements: Mobile Tabs**

On mobile view of `/topics`, show:

```
[ 🧵 Discussions ]     [ ➕ Start Discussion ]
```

And remove tab for “Posts” entirely.

---

### 6. **Future-proof: Optional Enum in Database**

Add an enum-type `content_type` column if needed in a shared table in future, with values like:

* `post` (for social feed)
* `discussion` (for threaded topic)
* `comment` (for replies)

But for now, keep them separate for clarity.

Let me know if you want to refactor existing components or migrate any shared logic into a common layout. I can also help generate new DB schema for `topics` or `discussions`.
