Based on your user journey and the strategic messaging we've developed, my recommendation is to pursue a **hybrid model that integrates the plans' user experience but lists them separately for clarity.** This approach leverages the strengths of both a seamless user journey and a clean, maintainable backend.

Here is a breakdown of the arguments and the final recommendation.

### The Case for Integration (A Single User-to-Church Plan)

Integrating the plans makes sense from a user perspective because it aligns perfectly with the spiritual journey you've described.

* **Emotional and Aspirational Journey:** A user can start their journey with a Basic plan for personal growth. As they become more involved in their faith community and take on leadership roles, upgrading to a "Fellowship Plan" (Standard User) or "Shepherd Plan" (Church Leader) feels like a natural progression, not a sudden, disconnected commercial transaction.
* **Simplified User Flow:** A single, unified plan structure would streamline the in-app experience. When a user is given admin privileges, a simple notification could prompt them to manage their church's subscription, automatically upgrading the entire congregation.
* **Unified Identity:** A user's identity and permissions could be tied to a single subscription record, which dynamically changes based on their role and community affiliation.

### The Case for Separation (Two Distinct Plan Structures)

The biggest challenge with full integration is not in the user experience, but in the underlying business logic and codebase.

* **Architectural Complexity:** A church's subscription is fundamentally a business-to-business (B2B) plan. It involves managing multiple members, team permissions, and advanced tools like `AI Sermon Studio` and `Volunteer Management System` for a whole group, which is a different concern than a single user's credit limit. Combining these into a single plan would create a complex and error-prone billing system.
* **Security and Access Control:** The features and access controls for an individual user versus a church leader are drastically different. A separated plan structure allows for a cleaner, more secure implementation of role-based access control, ensuring that a regular user cannot accidentally access or modify church-level data.
* **Clarity of Value:** On your website, clearly separating the individual and church plans helps potential customers immediately identify which product is for them. It prevents confusion and makes the value proposition of each tier easy to understand.

### Final Recommendation: A Hybrid Model

My recommendation is to use a **hybrid approach that presents a unified journey to the user while maintaining a clean, separated architecture in the backend.**

1.  **Present Separate Plans on the Website:** On `soapboxsuperapp.com`, continue to list "Plans for Members" and "Plans for Churches" as distinct entities. This simplifies the marketing message and helps customers self-select the right product.

2.  **Create a Unified Experience In-App:** In the application itself, the user's journey should feel seamless. The transition from a personal subscription to a church subscription should be guided and celebrated.
    * **In-App Promotion:** When a user takes on an admin role, display an aspirational, mission-driven notification like: "Congratulations on becoming a church leader! You now have access to Shepherd Tools. To unlock these for your entire community, let's set up your church's subscription."
    * **Plan Transfer:** When a user's church activates a plan, automatically transfer their individual credits to the church's account pool or pause their individual billing. This prevents users from feeling like they are paying for redundant services.
    * **Unified Profile:** A single user profile should display both personal rewards and church-level privileges, showing a complete picture of their journey on the platform.
