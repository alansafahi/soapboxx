High Priority – Harassment & Inappropriate Content
⚠️ These issues require immediate moderation and may include offensive, harmful, or emotionally damaging behavior.

🚨 Examples:
Direct harassment or bullying in prayer comments or discussion threads
(e.g., “You’re a fake Christian and you should leave this app”)

Sexual or violent language
(e.g., graphic content, threats, adult language)

Hate speech or discrimination based on faith, race, gender, or sexual orientation
(e.g., “All [group] should go to hell” or antisemitic remarks)

Blasphemous, mocking, or profane misuse of Scripture or sacred topics
(e.g., misusing verses to insult others)

Predatory behavior toward minors or inappropriate private messaging

System Action: Automatically escalated for admin review and temporarily hidden until resolved.

🟡 Medium Priority – Other User Reports
These are non-threatening but still important for maintaining community standards and platform trust.

📝 Examples:
Theological disagreements escalating in tone
(e.g., “Your doctrine is wrong and misleading” in a non-hateful way)

Off-topic or disruptive posts in event threads or Bible studies

Misinformation (e.g., misquoting scripture in a misleading way)

Impersonation of pastors or church staff

Overuse of AI-generated content that feels spammy but isn’t malicious

Inappropriate profile pictures (non-sexual but odd or misleading)

System Action: Notified to moderators, but not auto-hidden unless flagged multiple times.

🟢 Low Priority – Automated Spam & System Flags
These are caught by automated systems using AI/spam detection models.

🤖 Examples:
Mass posting of the same content across multiple churches or discussion threads
(e.g., promoting a personal YouTube channel in multiple posts)

Repeated AI-prayers or posts with no context

Suspicious links (e.g., external donation sites, crypto schemes)

Foreign-language posts with non-church content in English-speaking churches

System Action: Temporarily muted or rate-limited; reviewed periodically by moderators.

🔵 Critical Priority – Reserved (For Future Use)
For extreme cases like safety threats, legal violations, or app-wide disruption.

🔒 Potential Future Examples:
Credible suicide or self-harm statements (auto-flagged for escalation)

Coordinated misinformation campaigns against churches or denominations

Data breach or exposure of private member information

Direct threats against pastors, churches, or user safety

System Action: Immediate lockdown of content, emergency escalation to platform admins and church admins.
