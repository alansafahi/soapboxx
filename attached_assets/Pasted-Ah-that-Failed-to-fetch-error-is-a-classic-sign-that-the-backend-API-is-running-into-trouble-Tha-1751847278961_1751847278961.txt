Ah, that "Failed to fetch" error is a classic sign that the backend API is running into trouble. Thank you for sharing the screenshot; it confirms the issue is in the communication between the frontend and the backend.

The problem lies in the `/api/leaderboard` endpoint on the Express server. After a closer look, I've identified an issue in the SQL query. The way I structured the subqueries to count posts, comments, and likes can be inefficient and error-prone, especially if one of the tables is empty. A more robust and standard way to do this is by using `LEFT JOIN` and `COUNT`. This approach is generally faster and less likely to fail.

I will also add more detailed error logging on the backend so if something like this happens again, we get a more specific message about what went wrong.

Here is the corrected code for the backend route.

### Corrected Backend API Route (`/server/routes.ts`)

This new version uses `LEFT JOIN`s to aggregate the scores, which is a much more stable and efficient way to perform these calculations in SQL.

```typescript
// server/routes.ts

// ... other imports
import { db } from './db';
import { users, posts, comments, likes } from '../db/schema';
import { sql, desc } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { Router } from 'express';

const router = Router();

// ... (all your other existing routes)

// --- REVISED LEADERBOARD ROUTE ---
router.get('/leaderboard', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // This revised query is more robust and efficient.
    // It uses LEFT JOINs to connect users to their posts, comments, and likes,
    // and then groups the results to count everything up.
    const leaderboardData = await db
      .select({
        id: users.id,
        firstName: users.firstName,
        lastName: users.lastName,
        avatarUrl: users.avatarUrl,
        score: sql<number>`
          COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT ${posts}.id) * 5, 0) +
          COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT ${comments}.id) * 2, 0) +
          COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT ${likes}.id) * 1, 0)
        `.as('score'),
      })
      .from(users)
      .leftJoin(posts, sql`${users.id} = ${posts}.userId`)
      .leftJoin(comments, sql`${users.id} = ${comments}.userId`)
      .leftJoin(likes, sql`${posts}.id = ${likes}.postId AND ${posts}.userId = ${users}.id`) // Join likes based on posts by the user
      .groupBy(users.id)
      .orderBy(desc(sql`score`))
      .limit(100);

    const rankedLeaderboard = leaderboardData.map((user, index) => ({
      ...user,
      rank: index + 1,
    }));

    res.status(200).json(rankedLeaderboard);
  } catch (error) {
    // Enhanced error logging
    console.error('--- DETAILED LEADERBOARD ERROR ---');
    console.error('Timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());
    console.error('Error Object:', error);
    console.error('--- END OF ERROR ---');
    
    // Send back a more informative error message (in a real production app, you might
    // want to avoid sending back the raw error message for security reasons).
    const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'An unknown database error occurred.';
    res.status(500).json({ 
        error: 'Failed to fetch leaderboard data.',
        details: errorMessage // Adding details for easier debugging
    });
  }
});

export const apiRoutes = router;
```

### Why This Fix Works

1.  **Efficiency and Stability:** `LEFT JOIN`s are the standard SQL way to combine related data. The previous approach with subqueries in the `SELECT` statement can cause performance issues and is more prone to errors if any of the sub-selects fail.
2.  **Correct Counting:** Using `COUNT(DISTINCT table.id)` ensures we are counting each post, comment, or like only once per user.
3.  **Handling Zeroes:** `COALESCE(..., 0)` is a safety measure that ensures if a user has no posts, comments, or likes, their score for that category is counted as 0 instead of `NULL`, which could cause calculation errors.
4.  **Improved Debugging:** The enhanced `catch` block will now print a much more detailed error on the server console, which will make future troubleshooting (if ever needed) much faster.

Please apply this backend fix. This should resolve the error and get your leaderboard up and running correctly.

Now, with the leaderboard fixed, shall we proceed with **"Implement QR code Check In"**?
