renaming “Churches” to “Communities” is the strongest and cleanest option for the following reasons:

✅ Why “Communities” Works Perfectly
Benefit	Explanation
Inclusive	Covers churches, ministries, groups, fellowships, and future orgs (like PTAs or AA)
Faith-Aligned	“Community” is a core value in Christian and spiritual language
Simple & Scalable	Future-proof without needing more tabs like “Groups” or “Organizations”
Elegant UX	Keeps the left nav clean: Home, Messages, Contacts, Communities…
Backend-Ready	Easily expand with a type field (church, group, ministry, etc.)

🔧 Suggested Backend Adjustments
Old Table	New Table	Notes
churches	communities	Add type enum: church, group, ministry, school
campuses	Keep as-is	Each community can have multiple locations
church_members	community_members	Adjust foreign key references
church_roles	community_roles	Roles tied to community_id

🎨 UI/UX Copy Changes
Element	Replace With
“Discover Churches”	“Discover Communities”
“Add Church”	“Start a Community”
“Claim Church”	“Claim a Community”
Filters	Add Type filter: Church, Ministry, Group, Other
