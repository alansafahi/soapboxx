Yes — **giving users the option to choose between email and mobile verification** is the **ideal approach** for SoapBox Super App.

Here’s why:

---

## ✅ **Why Offering a Choice Is the Smart Move**

### 🔄 **1. Reduces Drop-off**

* Giving users **control over how they verify** avoids alienating those who:

  * Don’t want to share their mobile number
  * Have inconsistent SMS access
  * Are older, international, or privacy-conscious

### 🧠 **2. Aligns With Trust-Centric, Faith-Based UX**

* Respect for agency and accessibility is consistent with a spiritual, community-first platform
* Prevents the perception of “surveillance” or commercial harvesting

### 🌍 **3. Supports Global & Cross-Demographic Use**

* Users in developing countries or using tablets/Wi-Fi-only devices often **don’t have SMS**
* Missionaries or international members may not have stable mobile numbers

### 🔐 **4. Maintains Security While Offering Flexibility**

* Email verification is **still secure enough** for general user roles
* Mobile verification can be **required selectively** (e.g., for admins or volunteers)
