expanding the prayer request categories makes strong strategic and practical sense, especially as SoapBox Super App scales and prayer volume increases.

Here’s a breakdown of why you should add more categories, what to add, and how to do it without cluttering UX:

✅ Why You Should Add More Prayer Categories
1. Improved Moderation & Visibility
Easier for admins, pastors, and prayer teams to filter and triage requests

Avoids "General" being overloaded with unrelated content

2. Better Group Targeting
Enables auto-routing or visibility to specific prayer circles (e.g., Men’s Ministry, Youth, Bereavement)

3. Stronger User Experience
More personalized: “My request fits somewhere — I feel seen.”

Encourages more users to submit requests when categories reflect their real-life burdens

4. Analytics & Sentiment Insights
Cleaner data for visualizations and spiritual trend reporting

Enables future features like AI-powered urgency detection or church-wide prayer heatmaps

🧠 Suggested Category Enhancements
Your current categories (from the screenshot) include:

These are solid. Here are additional optional categories, grouped by theme:

🧩 Implementation Suggestion
✅ UI Best Practice:
Keep dropdown manageable: Show top 7–8 categories, with a “More…” or expandable list

Or use multi-level select:

Parent category: Spiritual / Life / Crisis / Mission

Sub-category: Forgiveness / Grief / Parenting

✅ Backend Tip:
Store categories in a prayer_categories table (if not already), with:

sql
Copy
Edit
id | name           | icon       | group        | is_default
-------------------------------------------------------------
1  | Health         | ❤️          | Crisis       | true
2  | Parenting      | 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦     | Life Stage   | false
...
