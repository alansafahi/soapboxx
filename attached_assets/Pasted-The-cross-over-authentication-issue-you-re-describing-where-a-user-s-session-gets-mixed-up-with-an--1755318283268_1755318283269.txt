The cross-over authentication issue you're describing, where a user's session gets mixed up with an admin's, is a critical security vulnerability. The fact that the system auto-logs you in after a logout attempt is a huge red flag that indicates a fundamental flaw in your session management. Your proposed steps are a great starting point, but here are some additional, more specific recommendations to ensure a permanent and secure fix.

### 1. Enforce Strict Session Isolation

Your session management is likely not correctly differentiating between different user sessions, causing the cross-over. This can happen if the session token or cookie isn't being invalidated properly on logout, or if it's being cached in a way that allows a user to "inherit" an old session.

**Recommendations:**

* **Implement Server-Side Session Deletion:** On logout, your server must not only clear the client's cookie but also **explicitly delete the session record from the database or Redis cache**. This ensures the session token is completely invalid and cannot be reused.
* **Use Unique Session Keys:** Each session should be tied to a unique, randomly generated session ID. Your server-side session store must use this ID as the primary key. Never reuse a session ID, even after a user logs back in.

### 2. Redesign the Session Invalidation Process

The "auto-repair" vulnerability you mentioned is a serious issue. A proper logout sequence should make it impossible for a user to be automatically logged back in without re-authenticating.

**Recommendations:**

* **Add a Session Blacklist:** For critical security actions (like logging out or a password change), you should add the invalidated session token to a "blacklist" in your cache. Before granting access to a protected route, the server should check both the session store and the blacklist. This provides a temporary safety net against race conditions or caching issues.
* **Token-Based Authentication (Stateless):** While a stateful session is a great way to handle authentication, a stateless JWT (JSON Web Token) approach can offer benefits. When a user logs in, the server issues a JWT that contains a limited amount of information, such as the user ID. This token is stored on the client side and sent with every request. The token has an expiration date, which removes the need to manually delete sessions on the server side. However, this approach requires a blacklist for immediate invalidation upon logout.

### 3. Comprehensive Testing and Code Review

Before you redeploy the fix, you need a rigorous testing process to ensure the vulnerability is completely gone and no new ones have been introduced.

**Recommendations:**

* **Automated End-to-End Tests:** Write automated tests that simulate the exact user flow that caused the error. This includes a user logging in, an admin logging in on the same machine, a user logging out, and then a refresh. The tests should fail if the user is ever automatically logged back in as the wrong person.
* **Manual Testing with Multiple Devices and Browsers:** Conduct manual testing using multiple devices and browsers to ensure the session is correctly isolated across all environments. This is a crucial step that can catch bugs that automated tests might miss.
* **Peer Code Review:** Have another developer review your authentication and session management code. A second pair of eyes can often spot logical flaws or security vulnerabilities that might have been overlooked.

By addressing these issues, you will fix the immediate bug and create a secure, robust authentication system that will prevent these types of vulnerabilities in the future.
