Here’s a structured set of **filtering categories** you could add to the Reading Plans page so users can quickly narrow down to exactly what they want. I’ve grouped them so they make sense in the UI and won’t overwhelm people:

---

* **By Duration**:

  * Less than 30 days
  * 1–3 months
  * 4–6 months
  * 7–12 months
  * Over 1 year
* **Daily Time Needed**:

  * 5–10 min/day
  * 10–20 min/day
  * 20+ min/day

---

## 2. **Bible Content Focus**

* **Testament**:

  * Old Testament
  * New Testament
  * Both / Whole Bible
* **Structure**:

  * Chronological Order
  * Historical Order
  * Canonical Order
* **Book-Specific Plans**:

  * Individual Books (e.g., “Psalms,” “Romans,” “John”)
  * Author Collections (e.g., Pauline Letters)

---

## 3. **Theme or Life Stage**

* Seasonal:

  * Advent & Christmas
  * Lent & Easter

## 4. **Bible Translation**

* “Multiple translations” option

---

## 5. **Difficulty / Depth**

* Advanced (includes commentary, Greek/Hebrew notes)

---

## 6. **Format & Media**

---

## 7. **Community Engagement**

---

### **Extra UI Recommendations**

* **Multi-select filters** so users can layer (e.g., “New Testament” + “Less than 3 months” + “NIV”).
* **Quick Filter Buttons** at the top for the most-used categories (e.g., “Whole Bible in a Year,” “Psalms & Proverbs,” “Seasonal Plans”).
* **Saved Filters** so a user’s preferences load automatically next time.

If you’d like, I can **mock up a visual filter bar** for this Reading Plans page so it fits the style you already have on SoapBox and avoids clutter. That way it’s ready for your dev team to drop in. Would you like me to do that next?
