Creating **Devotional Audio Routines** on SoapBox is a powerful way to help users build consistent spiritual habits through guided, emotionally relevant, voice-driven experiences. Here's a complete breakdown of what should be included:

---

## 🔊 SoapBox Devotional Audio Routine Structure

### 1. **Mood or Theme Tag**

* Personalizes content based on how the user feels or what they need:

  * *Anxious, Grateful, Seeking Guidance, Feeling Broken, Waiting, Overwhelmed, etc.*

---

### 2. **Routine Components (Each Segment Should Be <2 min)**

#### ✅ **Opening Reflection (30–45 sec)**

* Spoken intro with soft background music
* Acknowledge the user's mood:
  *“If you’re feeling anxious today, you’re not alone…”*

#### ✅ **Scripture Reading (1–2 verses)**

* Spoken word with pause for reflection
  *e.g., Philippians 4:6–7, Psalm 23, Isaiah 40:31*

#### ✅ **Guided Prayer**

* Based on the theme/mood (1 min max)
* Calm, compassionate tone:
  *“Father, calm my heart today. Help me release what I cannot control…”*

#### ✅ **Meditation Prompt / Silence (optional)**

* 30 seconds of instrumental music or silence with a soft chime

#### ✅ **Spoken Blessing or Closing**
