Your Suggestions Are Great
Each of the plans you've suggested serves a specific and valuable purpose for a user's spiritual growth journey:

"New Testament in a Year": This is a popular and approachable plan for users who want a focused, manageable reading plan without the commitment of the entire Bible.

"Gospels in 40 Days": This shorter plan is perfect for new users or for seasonal devotions (e.g., Lent), offering a deep dive into the life of Jesus without being overwhelming.

"Old Testament in a Year": This plan caters to a different, often more dedicated user segment who wants to engage with the biblical narrative from the beginning.

"Chronological Order" & "As It Happened": These are powerful tools for a deeper understanding of the Bible's historical context. They are perfect for users who are seeking a more academic or immersive study experience.

My Suggestions for Additional Plans
Based on the features already present in the SoapBox Super App, here are some additional suggestions that would provide even greater differentiation and value:

Thematic Journeys (leveraging AI): Your app's AI can analyze a user's mood and spiritualInterests to suggest a short, thematic reading plan. This could be a 7-day plan on topics like "Peace in Anxiety" or "Joy in Gratitude," with the verses selected by the AI. This would make the app feel deeply personal.

Audio Bible Journey (leveraging AI): The platform already has an AI-Powered Audio Bible. You could create plans designed specifically for audio consumption, such as "Psalms for a Quiet Mind" or "Epistles for a Morning Commute."

Character-Based Studies: A reading plan that focuses on a specific biblical character, such as "The Journey of David" or "Paul's Missionary Adventures," would be a very engaging way to study the Bible as a story.

Topical Deep Dives: Instead of just a daily verse, a plan could focus on a key topic like "Forgiveness" or "Stewardship." This plan would include a weekly sermon, S.O.A.P. journaling prompts, and a series of scripture passages to explore throughout the week.

How to Differentiate the Plans by Tier
You can use these new plan types to create a compelling upgrade path for users:

Basic (Free) Plan: Would have access to standard, pre-built plans like "New Testament in a Year" and "Old Testament in a Year."

Standard Plan: Would unlock shorter, more focused plans like the "Gospels in 40 Days," character-based studies, and the ability to create simple custom plans.

Premium Plan: This tier would get access to the most dynamic features, such as AI-curated thematic journeys, personalized AI Audio Bible routines, and chronological plans.

This approach creates a clear hierarchy of value that encourages users to upgrade as their spiritual journey deepens and their needs become more specific.
