It does not make sense to ask new users to select a Current Reading Plan or enter a Prayer Request during initial onboarding. Here's why — and how to redesign it for a better user experience:

🛑 Why You Should Not Prompt This During Onboarding
1. Cognitive Overload
Onboarding is already filled with profile creation, verification, spiritual preferences, etc.

Asking users to choose a Bible reading plan before they’ve even seen any options or context is like asking someone to join a book club before knowing what books are offered.

2. Lack of Meaningful Input
New users haven’t explored the app yet, so they lack:

Familiarity with available reading plans

Context to know what “Custom Plan” even means

Confidence to share a personal prayer request with a community they haven’t met yet

Prompting these fields too early risks either:

Users skipping them (which creates empty states or placeholder errors like you’re seeing)

Or users dropping off entirely

3. UX Breakdown in Your Screenshot
The error A <Select.Item> must have a non-empty string shows the select input was rendered without a valid default.

That’s a direct result of requiring a selection too early in the flow.

✅ What You Should Do Instead
📥 Auto-populate reading plan only when one is selected
Set "None selected" as the default

Auto-fill Current Reading Plan only when user joins a small group or picks a plan later

Add a tooltip: “This will auto-update when you join a group or choose a reading plan.”

🙏 Prayer Request Should Be an Optional Feature Prompt
Introduce this after the user explores the Prayer Wall

You can ask:

“Would you like to share a prayer request with your church or small group?”
Include opt-in privacy settings (Public, Church Only, Private)

🔄 Alternative Flow Suggestion (Mobile-First and Engagement-Smart)
During onboarding:
Just show:

✅ “You can choose a Bible reading plan later”
✅ “You can submit prayer requests any time from the Prayer Wall”

After onboarding:
Use nudges:

“🙏 Haven’t picked a reading plan yet? Explore our top devotionals.”

“📖 Most members in your group are doing the ‘Gospel of Mark’ plan. Want to join?”

If a group is joined:
Automatically suggest or assign the group’s current plan.

🏁 Conclusion
Feature	Ask on Onboarding?	Why
📖 Reading Plan	❌ No	Requires context, feels arbitrary without exploration
🙏 Prayer Request	❌ No	Deeply personal, better after some app trust is built
✅ Profile info (spiritual goals, church affiliation)	✅ Yes	Helps personalize content and suggest features
