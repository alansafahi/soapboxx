Here are the comprehensive instructions for Replit, integrating your latest strategic suggestions. This document outlines a complete implementation plan to transform the pricing and reward system from a feature-based model to a values-driven, gamified, and aspirational user journey.

### Instructions for Replit to Implement a Growth-Focused Strategy

This document details all necessary code modifications to implement the revised, growth-oriented pricing and rewards system for the SoapBox Super App and its companion website. These changes are crucial for attracting and retaining users while maintaining a sound financial model.

All modifications must strictly adhere to the **SoapBox Development Standards, v. 1.0**.

-----

### Part 1: Updates to the `SoapBox-Super-App` Backend

The primary changes will be made in the backend logic to ensure the reward system is accurate and consistent with the new point values, and to lay the groundwork for a gamified user journey.

1.  **Correct Reward System Discrepancies in `server/storage.ts`:**

      * **Referrals:** The `storage.processReferralReward` function must be updated to award a bonus of **500 points** for both the referrer and the referee, aligning with the new growth strategy.
      * **Discussions:** The `trackUserActivity` call within `storage.createDiscussion` must be updated to award **20 points**.
      * **Prayer Requests:** The `trackUserActivity` call for a new prayer request in `storage.createPrayerRequest` must be updated to award **25 points**.
      * **Events Attended:** The `trackUserActivity` call in `storage.checkInToEvent` must be updated to award **25 points**.
      * **S.O.A.P. Entries:** A new `trackUserActivity` call must be added to the `storage.createSoapEntry` function to award **15 points** for each new S.O.A.P. post.
      * **Prayer Responses/Support:** The `trackUserActivity` call for a prayer response in `storage.prayForRequest` should be updated to consistently award **5 points**.

2.  **Add New AI Feature Reward and Gamification Logic:**

      * **First AI-Assisted S.O.A.P. Entry:** Implement a new check in `server/routes.ts` within the AI-related endpoints (e.g., `/api/soap/ai/suggestions`) to reward a one-time bonus of **10 points** the first time a user generates an AI-assisted S.O.A.P. entry.
      * **S.O.A.P. Streaks:** Implement logic to award a **50-point bonus** when a user completes a 7-day S.O.A.P. streak, as tracked in `server/storage.ts`.
      * **Gamified "Missions":** The backend should include a new `missions` table and a corresponding endpoint (e.g., `/api/user/missions`) that allows a user to "unlock" rewards by completing a set of actions. For example, "Complete 5 devotions, post 5 prayers, and join a community group to unlock 7 days of Premium."

### Part 2: Updates to the `SoapBox-Super-App` Frontend and `soapboxsuperapp.com` Website

The front end and website must be updated to reflect the new, values-driven pricing plans and gamified rewards. The goal is to move from "unlocking features" to "spiritual progression."

1.  **Revise Pricing Tables and Aspirational Language:**

      * **Website Update (`soapboxsuperapp.com`):** The pricing table on the website and all in-app pricing displays must be updated to reflect the new values.

2.  **Implement Grace-Driven Paywall Language:**

      * **Replace "Upgrade Now"** with phrases like **"Step deeper into your calling"** or **"Unlock new spiritual tools."**
      * **Replace "Premium Plan"** with an aspirational name like **"Fellowship Plan"** or **"Journey Plan."**
      * **Replace "Admin Tools"** with **"Shepherd Tools"** for church leaders.
      * Update all in-app and on-site copy to align with this new, humble, and spiritual messaging.

3.  **Integrate Gamification and Reward System UI:**

      * **"Level Up" Prompts:** After a user completes a reward-eligible action (e.g., 7-day S.O.A.P. streak, 5 prayer posts), display a dynamic, celebratory prompt. The prompt should not just mention points but also tie the achievement to spiritual growth (e.g., "Congratulations on your 7-day SOAP streak\! You've leveled up in discipline and consistency. You've been rewarded with 50 points to fuel your spiritual journey.")
      * **Milestone Badges:** Design and implement a set of badges (e.g., "Shepherd of the Word," "Faithful Giver") to be awarded upon upgrading to a paid plan. The badge should be displayed on the user's profile and notifications.
      * **"Missions" Feature:** Create a new UI component for the "Missions" feature that guides users to complete actions to earn rewards or temporary access to a paid plan. This can serve as a powerful tool for driving freemium conversions.

These changes will successfully align your product's strategy with your business goals, making the app more attractive to new users and ensuring its financial viability as it scales.
