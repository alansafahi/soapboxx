Instructions for Replit to Implement Consolidation
The goal is to centralize all point-awarding logic in a single function, addPointsToUser, and rename the user_scores table to user_points to better reflect its purpose.

Refactor the Database Schema (shared/schema.ts):

Rename the userScores table to userPoints for consistent naming.

Add a reason field to the pointTransactions table to log the specific action that earned the points (e.g., 'referral_reward', 'discussion_post').

Consolidate Point Logic in server/storage.ts:

Create a new, universal addPointsToUser function that takes userId, points, and reason as arguments. This function should perform the following actions:

Update the user's total, weekly, and monthly points in the new userPoints table.

Create a record in the pointTransactions table.

Update any relevant achievement or badge progress.

Replace all existing point-awarding logic with calls to this new addPointsToUser function:

processReferralReward: Call addPointsToUser with the reason 'referral_reward'.

createDiscussion: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'discussion_post'.

createPrayerRequest: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'prayer_request'.

checkInToEvent: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'event_attended'.

createSoapEntry: A new call to addPointsToUser needs to be added here with the reason 'soap_entry'.

createDiscussionComment: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'discussion_comment'.

createSoapComment: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'soap_comment'.

likeDiscussion: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'discussion_like'.

addEventVolunteer: Update to call addPointsToUser with the reason 'volunteering'.

joinCommunityGroup: A new call to addPointsToUser needs to be added here with the reason 'group_joined'.

createCommunityGroup: A new call to addPointsToUser needs to be added here with the reason 'group_created'.

addContact: A new call to addPointsToUser needs to be added here with the reason 'contact_added'.

All other point-awarding actions should be refactored to use this single function.

Update server/routes.ts:

Ensure all backend endpoints that award points are correctly calling the new addPointsToUser function with the appropriate points and reason.

Update any endpoints that query user points to pull from the new, unified userPoints table.
