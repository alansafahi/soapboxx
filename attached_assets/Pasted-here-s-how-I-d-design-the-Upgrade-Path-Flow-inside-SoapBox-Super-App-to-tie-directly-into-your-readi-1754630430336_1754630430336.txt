here’s how I’d design the Upgrade Path Flow inside SoapBox Super App to tie directly into your reading plans and make users feel like they’re naturally “graduating” to the next tier.

Upgrade Path Flow for Reading Plans
1. Trigger Moments
We don’t just show “Upgrade” buttons — we catch users at moments of spiritual momentum:

Plan Completion Screen: After finishing a Disciple plan, show a celebratory screen with a badge + invitation to start a Servant plan.

Mid-Plan Peak Engagement: At 50% completion of a plan, show “Next Steps” recommendations from the next tier.

Feature Curiosity: If a user taps a locked feature (parallel Bible, AI commentary, audio), show an upgrade preview.

2. Visual Structure
Top Section — Celebration

Confetti animation + “Well Done, [First Name]!”

Highlight the spiritual achievement: “You’ve just completed Psalms & Proverbs in 90 Days.”

Middle Section — Unlock Vision

Title: “It’s time to go deeper.”

Show the next-tier benefits in context:

For Disciple → Servant: “Add life application themes, character studies, and group sync.”

For Servant → Torchbearer: “Unlock full-Bible timelines, AI audio, and historical insights.”

Bottom Section — Easy Next Step

One-click Start Your Next Plan button (includes free trial of next tier).

Subtext: “Continue your journey today — first 7 days on us.”

3. Psychological Drivers
Progression Language: Use terms like “Next Step,” “Level Up,” and “Go Deeper” instead of “Upgrade.”

Narrative Growth: Link tier names to spiritual growth stages (Disciple → Servant → Torchbearer).

Social Proof: Show a quote or stat — “3,482 members completed the Journey of Paul and loved it!”

Loss Aversion: “Don’t miss next week’s AI-led thematic deep dive — only available in Servant Plan.”

4. Cross-Tier Features for Pull
From Tier	Teaser Feature	Why It Works
Disciple → Servant	Group Plan Sync	“Join your small group in studying Paul’s letters together.”
Servant → Torchbearer	AI Audio Bible + Timelines	“Experience the Gospels during your commute with historical context.”

5. Integration with Churches
If a pastor recommends a plan in Servant or Torchbearer tiers, show a “Your Pastor Invited You” banner with an upgrade trial link.

This makes it relational instead of transactional.
