🔧 Recommendations for SEO Optimization
1. Add Keyword-Rich Descriptions (without stuffing)
Refine subtexts to include high-intent search phrases used by faith leaders and church admins:

Before:
“No data reselling or ad tracking—your information stays sacred.”

After:
“We protect your church data with faith-first privacy—no ad tracking, no data resale, ever.”

Keywords added: “church data”, “faith-first privacy”

2. Optimize the Section Header
Before:

Safe, Secure & Spirit-Led

After (SEO-optimized):

Faith-Based Technology That’s Safe, Secure & Spirit-Led
or
Secure Church Software Built with Faith and Privacy in Mind

Keywords added: "church software", "faith-based technology", "secure"

3. Structured HTML with <section> & <h2> Tags
Ensure the container uses semantic HTML for better indexing.
E.g.:

html
Copy
Edit
<section aria-labelledby="faith-tech-security">
  <h2 id="faith-tech-security">Faith-Based Technology That’s Safe, Secure & Spirit-Led</h2>
</section>
4. Add Alt Text to Icons (Accessibility + SEO Bonus)
Each icon should have descriptive alt attributes like:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="lock-icon.svg" alt="Faith-based data privacy icon">
5. “Faith Tech Movement” Block – Add Long-Tail Keywords
You currently have:

Grow. Connect. Pray. Reflect. Serve—together.

Consider expanding to:

Empower your church to grow, connect, pray, reflect, and serve using AI-assisted digital ministry tools designed for spiritual communities.

Keywords added: “digital ministry tools”, “AI-assisted church apps”, “spiritual communities”
