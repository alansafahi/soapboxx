Root Cause Debug Checklist
✅ 1. Check communities table schema (Replit DB or Postgres)
Ensure it includes the following:

Column	Type	Required	Default
name	VARCHAR	✅	—
type	VARCHAR(50)	✅	'church'
address	VARCHAR	✅	—
city	VARCHAR	✅	—
state	VARCHAR	✅	—
zip_code	VARCHAR	✅	—
admin_email	VARCHAR	✅	—
admin_phone	VARCHAR(20)	✅	—
created_by	VARCHAR(255)	✅	—
website	VARCHAR	❌	nullable
description	TEXT	❌	nullable

Check for:

Typos (e.g., zipCode vs zip_code)

Missing or null constraints that break the insert query

✅ 2. Validate API Route Code
Inspect your API handler for POST /api/communities (or wherever the createCommunity function lives):

Common issues:
Attempting to insert undefined into a required column

Failing to handle camelCase → snake_case mapping

Trying to insert into renamed table (churches vs communities)

Not catching thrown errors (try/catch missing)

🔧 Add a console.log(req.body) and console.error(err) to confirm payload + backend error stack

✅ 3. Confirm Frontend → API Payload
Your payload from React should look like this before sending:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Group",             // or use a proper name field
  "type": "group",
  "address": "123 Main street",
  "city": "LA",
  "state": "CA",
  "zip_code": "90210",
  "admin_email": "alan@safahi.com",
  "admin_phone": "7149062548",
  "website": "safahi.com",
  "description": "Help reunited lost animals with their owners",
  "created_by": "USER_ID"
}
Make sure you're:

Not missing name

Not sending raw "null" or undefined for required fields

Using the correct snake_case naming if sending directly to SQL

✅ Fix Recommendations
If you're using a prisma or sequelize model, make sure it maps to the communities table.

ts
Copy
Edit
await db.insertInto('communities').values({
  name,
  type,
  address,
  city,
  state,
  zip_code,
  admin_email,
  admin_phone,
  website,
  description,
  created_by,
});
And wrap it:

ts
Copy
Edit
try {
  // creation logic
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error creating community:', err);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error', error: err.message });
}
✅ Next Steps
Log request body and errors on backend

Confirm name is passed (currently just “Group”? Might need full name)

Match all required schema fields

Re-deploy or restart Replit backend if schema or DB was changed

Once fixed, test community creation again
